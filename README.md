# MCPSalerts
Alerts you if school is cancelled or delayed and texts you faster than mcps system. Runs on MCPS website, can be adapted for others.

# How this works:
I use your gmail account to text your phone number through google's mail to text system. Don't worry, your information is only stored locally on your computer and nowhere else. 

# Modules required:
## Requests,
## Time,
## Smtplib,
## Sys

Firstly, install python 3 if you have not already. Just google python 3 install.

Then, enable less secure apps @ https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps

Install pip if you have not already @ https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/. Type "pip install (module here)" for each module in a terminal window. If you don't know what terminal is, search it on your computer and open it. Then run the script by typing "cd " then drag the "MCPSalerts" folder to terminal. Then type "python3 mcpsv2.py"

Input all information and it will run.


Enjoy your snow day!
